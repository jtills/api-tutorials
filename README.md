Playing with some free APIs

weather.py is from a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWZKTWJ9bJE, 
takes user input for a city or region and uses openweathermap.org to return location and weather data. 

translator.py takes user choice of 'language' (e.g 'morse' or 'yoda') and a text to translate, uses api.funtranslations.com to return
translated text
